# R Cheat Sheet

This document introduces you to basic R concepts. No programming background is neededâ€”each term is explained in simple terms.

## Variable Structures in R
- **Data Frame:**
  A table-like structure with rows and columns. Each column can store a different data type, making it ideal for organizing datasets.
- **Tibble:**
  A modern version of a data frame, offering improved printing behavior and no row names by default.
- **Vector:**
  A one-dimensional collection that holds elements of the same data type.
- **List:**
  An ordered collection that can store elements of different types, allowing greater flexibility.
- **Matrix:**
  A two-dimensional version of a vector with rows and columns, where all elements share the same type.
- **Array:**
  A multi-dimensional collection, similar to a matrix but capable of handling more than two dimensions.

## Data Types in R
- **Numeric:**
  The default type used for numbers, including decimals.
- **Factor:**
  A special structure for categorical data that defines a limited set of values.
- **Integer:**
  Whole numbers explicitly defined with an "L" suffix (e.g., 10L).
- **Logical:**
  Represents Boolean values: TRUE or FALSE.
- **Character:**
  Text strings used to represent words or sentences.
- **Complex:**
  Numbers that include both a real and an imaginary component (e.g., 2+3i).
- **Raw:**
  Used for storing raw byte data.
